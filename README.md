## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ✅ Node.js v18+ (for frontend)
- ✅ Ruby 3.0+ & Rails 7+ (for backend)
- ✅ PostgreSQL (or SQLite for development)
- ✅ Git

---

### Clone & Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/abdul-kasif/qlock-staff.git
cd qlock-staff

# 2. Switch to develop branch (ALWAYS start from here!)
git checkout develop

# 3. Install dependencies

# For Frontend (React + Vite)
cd frontend
npm install

# For Backend (Rails)
cd ../backend
bundle install
rails db:setup  # or: rails db:create db:migrate
```

💡 **Note:** Never work directly on the `main` branch. Always use `develop` as your base.

---

## ▶️ Running the App

### Backend (Rails API)

```bash
cd backend
rails s -p 3000
# ➜ API runs at: http://localhost:3000
```

Test with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
# Expected: { "status": "ok" }
```

---

### Frontend (React + Vite)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# ➜ UI runs at: http://localhost:5173
```
---

## 🌲 Git Workflow

We follow a simplified Git Flow:

```
main          ← Production (Abdul only)
  ↑
develop       ← Integration branch (ALL work merged here)
  ↑     ↑     ↑
feature/*   feature/login-api   feature/dashboard   (your branches)
```

---

### ✅ Your Daily Steps

```bash
# 1. Get latest changes
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# 2. Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-task-name

# 3. Work → Commit often
git add .
git commit -m "feat: describe your work"

# 4. Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-task-name

# 5. Open PR on GitHub → Tag @abdul
#    Wait for review → I’ll test + merge into develop

# 6. After merge → clean up
git checkout develop
git pull
git branch -d feature/your-task-name
```

📌 **Branch naming convention:**  
Examples → `feature/login-form`, `feature/api-user-profile`  
Be descriptive and specific.

---

## 🚫 Branching Rules

| Branch    | Who          | Purpose                   |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| `main`    | Abdul only  | Production-ready code     |
| `develop` | PRs only    | Integration & testing     |
| `feature/*` | Everyone  | Individual task branches  |

🔐 **Protected Branches:** `main` and `develop` → No direct pushes. Always open a PR.

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you’re stuck, don’t guess. Just ask:

```
Hey Abdul, I’m stuck on [step/task] — can you help?
```

⏱️ I’ll respond within **1 hour**. No shame. No delay. We’re a team.

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Always pull the latest `develop` before starting work.
- Commit **small and often**.
- Test your feature locally before opening a PR.
- Update `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` when you **start/finish** a task.
